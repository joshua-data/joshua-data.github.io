# 1.  Introduction

When you go to the Attribution Settings of Google Analytics 4, you can easily choose the Attribution Model that you love.

**Data Driven**
* It does not explicitly specify what kind of model is being used, and I think it’s a little risky when it comes to making a marketing decision.

**Last Click**
* The channel that immediately precedes the purchase is considered to have a 100% contribution.

**First Click**
* The channel that initially brings in the user is considered to have a 100% contribution.

**Linear**
* All channels, from the user’s initial acquisition channel to the channel immediately preceding the purchase, are considered to have an equal contribution of 1/N, where N represents the total number of channels.

> Google Analytics 4 > Acquisition > User Acquisition

However, due to the post hoc nature of Attribution Settings in Google Analytics 4, there is a limitation where if the marketing strategy changes, you would need to aggregate the data again from the beginning.

Therefore, considering alternatives outside of Google Analytics 4, I have started contemplating using BigQuery to apply Attribution Models more flexibly and regularly monitor them.

In this article, you will explore how to easily aggregate the Last Click Attribution Model using BigQuery.

# 2. Enable the export of Google Analytics 4 data to BigQuery.

# 3. Flatten Table

Unlike Bigtable, a column-wide store NoSQL database, BigQuery is a data warehouse. However, BigQuery still offers a lot of nested columns to handle future additions or deletions of schema, events, parameters, and more. For analytical purposes, it’s necessary to flatten tables composed of these columns to simplify queries.

# 4. Standardize the session UTM values for all events within each session.

For some reason that is not entirely clear, due to the inaccuracies in GA4, there are cases where the UTM values that contributed to the acquisition of specific sessions are occasionally lost.

| **User ID** | **Session ID** | **Event Name** | **Session Campaign** | **Session Medium** | **Session Source**
|-|-|-|-|-|-
|Joshua|12345|`session_start`|(n/a)|(n/a)|(n/a)
|Joshua|12345|`page_view`|summer-event|owned-media|facebook
|Joshua|12345|`user_engagement`|summer-event|owned-media|facebook
|Joshua|12345|`scroll`|(n/a)|(n/a)|(n/a)
|Joshua|12345|`begin_checkout`|summer-event|owned-media|facebook
|Joshua|12345|`add_payment_info`|summer-event|owned-media|facebook

I have encountered several weird cases like this.

Therefore, in such cases, if there are session UTM values within the same session, the UTM values from the first event that occurred should be propagated to all the other events within the same session, ensuring they have the same values.

```sql
CTE_session_campaign_sequence AS (
    SELECT
        user_pseudo_id, ga_session_id,
        session_campaign,
        session_medium,
        session_source,
        session_term,
        CASE
            WHEN session_campaign IS NOT NULL THEN
                ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                    PARTITION BY
                        user_pseudo_id, ga_session_id,
                        CASE WHEN session_campaign IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
                    ORDER BY
                        event_timestamp
                )
            WHEN session_campaign IS NULL THEN
                1
        END AS row_num
    FROM
        CTE_flattened
),

CTE_utm_spread AS ( -- spread session utm parameters throughout each user & session  
    SELECT  
        MAIN.* EXCEPT (session_campaign, session_medium, session_source, session_term),  
        SUB.real_session_campaign AS session_campaign,  
        SUB.real_session_medium AS session_medium,  
        SUB.real_session_source AS session_source,  
        SUB.real_session_term AS session_term  
    FROM 
        CTE_flattened MAIN  
    LEFT JOIN (  
        SELECT  
            user_pseudo_id, ga_session_id,  
            MAX(session_campaign) AS real_session_campaign,  
            MAX(session_medium) AS real_session_medium,  
            MAX(session_source) AS real_session_source,  
            MAX(session_term) AS real_session_term  
        FROM
            CTE_session_campaign_sequence
        WHERE
            row_num = 1
        GROUP BY
            user_pseudo_id, ga_session_id
    ) SUB
    ON 
        MAIN.user_pseudo_id = SUB.user_pseudo_id 
        AND MAIN.ga_session_id = SUB.ga_session_id  
    ORDER BY  
        MAIN.user_pseudo_id, MAIN.ga_session_id, MAIN.event_timestamp
),
```

# 5.  Replace NULL session UTM values with the value “`(direct)`”.

Personally, I tend to consider the “`(direct)`” values more as “unknown” rather than the direct traffic. Nevertheless, to ensure that calculations are not affected by NULL values during the aggregation process, here I proceeded with replacing all NULL values with “`(direct)`”.

```sql
CTE_fill_na AS ( -- Replace NULL session_utms with (direct)
    SELECT  
        * EXCEPT (session_campaign, session_medium, session_source, session_term),  
        IFNULL(session_campaign, '(direct)') AS session_campaign,  
        IFNULL(session_medium, '(none)') AS session_medium,  
        IFNULL(session_source, '(direct)') AS session_source,  
        IFNULL(session_term, '(direct)') AS session_term  
    FROM CTE_utm_spread  
),
```

# 6. Extract only the necessary columns for calculating attribution.

You only need the following columns:
* `user_pseudo_id`
* `event_date`
* `event_timestamp`
* `session_campaign`
* `session_medium`
* `session_source`
* `conversion` (whether they have made their purchase or not)
* `revenue` (total value of purchase)

```sql
CTE_user_sessions_channel_conversion AS (    
    SELECT
        user_pseudo_id,  
        event_date, event_timestamp,  
        session_campaign, session_medium, session_source,  
        CASE  
            WHEN event_name = 'session_start' THEN 0  
            WHEN event_name = 'purchase' THEN 1  
        END AS conversion,  
        event_value_in_usd AS revenue  
    FROM
        CTE_fill_na  
    WHERE  
        event_name IN (
            'session_start', 
            'purchase'
        )  
    ORDER BY  
        user_pseudo_id, event_timestamp  
),
```

# 7. Assign journey numbers to each user’s purchase event.

Since a user may make multiple purchases, it’s necessary to recalculate attribution after the first purchase event.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2023-07-09-last-click-attribution/joshua-flowchart-1.webp)

You’ll need to separate each journey when it comes to calculating Joshua’s attribution model.

```sql
CTE_purchase_journey AS (    
    SELECT  
        user_pseudo_id,  
        event_date, event_timestamp,  
        session_campaign, session_medium, session_source,  
        conversion,  
        revenue,  
        COALESCE(cumsum_conversion, 0) + 1 AS purchase_journey  
    FROM  
    (  
        SELECT  
            *,  
            SUM(conversion) OVER (  
                PARTITION BY user_pseudo_id  
                ORDER BY event_timestamp  
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING  
            ) AS cumsum_conversion  
        FROM
            CTE_user_sessions_channel_conversion  
    )  
    ORDER BY  
        user_pseudo_id, event_timestamp  
),
```

# 8. Assign Priorities to indicate the order of events for applying the Last Click Attribution Model.

When applying Last Click Attribution mechanically, there is a high possibility of incorrect attribution in cases like the following:
* Joshua was initially acquired through the Summer Event campaign, then explored other information, and later started a new session through a Google search before making a purchase.
* In this case, it should be considered that Joshua made the purchase not primarily due to the effectiveness of our Google SEO strategy, as he was already aware of our website. Instead, it can be attributed to the appeal of the Summer Event, which influenced his decision to make the purchase.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2023-07-09-last-click-attribution/joshua-flowchart-2.webp)

Therefore, I have assigned priorities based on the session_campaign as follows:
* 1 < `direct` < 2
* 2 < `organic` < 3
* 3 < `referral` < 4
* 4 < `identified campaign`

```sql
CTE_attribution_priority AS ( -- Adjusted Last Click Model
    SELECT  
        *,  
        CASE  
            WHEN session_campaign = '(direct)'
                THEN 1 + ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_pseudo_id, purchase_journey
                    ORDER BY event_timestamp
                ) / 1000  
            WHEN session_campaign = '(organic)'
                THEN 2 + ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_pseudo_id, purchase_journey 
                    ORDER BY event_timestamp
                ) / 1000  
            WHEN session_campaign = '(referral)'
                THEN 3 + ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_pseudo_id, purchase_journey
                    ORDER BY event_timestamp
                ) / 1000  
            ELSE 
                4 + ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_pseudo_id, purchase_journey 
                    ORDER BY event_timestamp
                ) / 1000  
        END AS attribution_priority  
    FROM
        CTE_purchase_journey
    ORDER BY  
        user_pseudo_id, event_timestamp    
),
```

# 9.  The `session_campaign` with the highest priority will be attributed to 100% of the revenue.

I have assigned priority classes based on the campaigns such as direct, organic, referral, and identifiable campaigns. However, within the same class, the attribution will be applied based on the most recent event, following the Last Click Attribution Model. Now, you can call this approach “**Joshua’s Adjusted Last Click Attribution Model**”. 😄

```sql
CTE_revenue_attribution AS (  
    SELECT  
        user_pseudo_id,  
        event_date, event_timestamp,  
        session_campaign, session_medium, session_source,  
        conversion,  
        revenue,  
        purchase_journey,  
        CASE  
            WHEN attribution_priority = MAX(attribution_priority) OVER (
                PARTITION BY user_pseudo_id, purchase_journey
            )  
                THEN MAX(revenue) OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_pseudo_id, purchase_journey
                )  
            ELSE 
                NULL  
        END AS revenue_attribution  
    FROM
        CTE_attribution_priority  
    ORDER BY  
        user_pseudo_id, event_timestamp  
)
```

# 10. Now, let’s perform the Last Click Attribution aggregation for each channel.

```sql
SELECT  
    CASE  
        WHEN session_campaign = '(organic)' THEN 'Search Engine'  
        WHEN session_campaign = '(direct)' THEN 'Direct or Unknown'
