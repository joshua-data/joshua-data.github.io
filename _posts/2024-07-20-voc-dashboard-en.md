> "I learned that internal team members were facing difficulties in following up on Zendesk customer inquiries, so I developed a Redash VOC dashboard to address this issue. The system automatically collected and preprocessed Zendesk data, then used the OpenAI API to categorize and summarize customer inquiries by topic. Additionally, a Slack notification was set up to alert the team each Monday about the topics with the highest increase in inquiries, helping identify and respond to customer issues more efficiently. As a result, we were able to eliminate about $275 in opportunity costs each month and reduce the time spent by team members on VOC follow-ups."

# 1. STAR Summary

### Situation
* Internal team members were struggling to efficiently track and follow up on Zendesk customer inquiries. Reading through all the inquiries required **an excessive amount of time and effort**, and implementing an external VOC analysis service posed **a cost burden**.

### Tasks
1. I decided to **categorize and summarize** customer inquiries and create a Redash VOC **dashboard**.
2. I also decided to build **a Slack notification bot** to alert the team about the most urgent customer inquiry topics.

### Actions
1. **Data Pipeline**

   1.1. Data Collection and Preprocessing `(Zendesk Tickets → Google Sheets → BigQuery)`

   1.2. Topic Categorization `(OpenAI API)`

   1.3. Summarization `(OpenAI API)`

2. **Dashboard and Notification Bot**

   2.1. Creating the Dashboard `(BigQuery → Redash)`

   2.2. Building the Notification Bot `(BigQuery → Slack API)`

### Results
1. **Cost Savings**
   * We solved the problem internally at a cost of $25 per month, avoiding the need for an external service that would have cost $300 per month.

2. **Time Savings**
   * The time required for internal team members to follow up on VOC, identify issues, and respond was significantly reduced.

# 2. Situation

> Internal team members were struggling to efficiently track and follow up on Zendesk customer inquiries. Reading through all the inquiries required **an excessive amount of time and effort**, and implementing an external VOC analysis service posed **a cost burden**.

### Specific Situation
* It was taking too much time to follow up on dozens to hundreds of customer inquiries each week.
* It was challenging to identify which topics were negatively impacting the customer experience.

### Feedback from Internal Team Members
* **C-level 1**: "I'm trying to stay on top of customer sentiment by regularly reading the inquiries, but there are just too many, and it's very time-consuming."
* **C-level 2**: "I'd like to introduce an external service for VOC analysis, but the cost is too high, so we're hesitant."
* **CX Manager**: "I want to share more VOC insights with colleagues and improve the speed of issue resolution."

##### 1.1. Data Collection and Preprocessing `(Zendesk Tickets → Google Sheets → BigQuery)`

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-07-20-voc-dashboard/3-en.png)

1) First, I used the **Zendesk Connector** available from Google Workspace Marketplace to automatically store completed Zendesk ticket data in a private Google Sheet.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-07-20-voc-dashboard/4.png)

2) I then loaded the Google Sheets data into Python.

<details>
<summary>View Code</summary>
<div markdown="1">
   ```python
   # Load Raw Data from Google Sheets (to `df`)
   gc = gspread.service_account(google_sheets_credentials_fpath)
   spreadsheet = gc.open_by_url(google_sheets_url)
   sheet = spreadsheet.worksheet(google_sheets_worksheet_name)
   sheet_data = sheet.get_all_records()
   df = pd.DataFrame(sheet_data)
   ```
</div>
</details>

3) After that, I proceeded with data preprocessing.

<details>
<summary>Filter Only Necessary Columns</summary>
<div markdown="1">
   ```python
   # Rename Columns
   df = df.rename(
      columns={
         'created_at': 'created_datetime',
         'raw_subject': 'subject',
         'tags.0': 'zendesk_topic',
         'updated_at': 'updated_datetime'
      }
   )
   # Extract Only Necessary Columns
   df = df[[
      'id',
      'created_datetime',
      'zendesk_topic',
      'subject',
      'description'
   ]]
   ```
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Change Timezone (UTC → KST)</summary>
<div markdown="1">
   ```python
   # Convert Existing Timestamps: UTC to KST
   kst = pytz.timezone('Asia/Seoul')
   df['created_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_datetime'], utc=True).dt.tz_convert(kst).dt.tz_localize(None)
   df = df.astype('str') # To load into BigQuery, all columns must be cast as strings.
   ```
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Filter Only New Entries</summary>
<div markdown="1">
   ```python
   # Remove Rows Already in Target Table (Prevent Duplicates)
   query = f'SELECT DISTINCT id FROM `{bigquery_tickets_table_id}`'
   try:
      existing_ids = client.query(query).to_dataframe()
      existing_ids = set(existing_ids['id'])
      df = df[
         ~ df['id'].isin(existing_ids)
      ].reset_index(drop=True)
   except:
      df = df
   ```
</div>
</details>

4) Finally, I loaded the data into the BigQuery table.

<div markdown="1">
   ```python
   # Load Data into BigQuery Table
   table = client.get_table(bigquery_tickets_table_id)

</div>
</details>

##### 1.2. Topic Categorization `(OpenAI API)`

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-07-20-voc-dashboard/5-en.png)

1) To predefine the list of topics to be categorized, I discussed and established a classification system with a CX manager and a UX/UI designer.

* **Topic**: Broad subject categories
* **Keyword**: Specific subtopics

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-07-20-voc-dashboard/6.png)

2) I loaded the data from the BigQuery table into Python.

<div markdown="1">
   ```python
   # Load BigQuery `tickets` Table (to `df`)
   query = f'SELECT * FROM {bigquery_tickets_table_id}'
   df = bigquery_client.query(query).to_dataframe()
   ```
</div>
</details>

3) I then filtered out only new entries.

<details>

      existing_ids = set(existing_ids['id'])
      df = df[
         ~ df['id'].isin(existing_ids)
      ].reset_index(drop=True)
   except:
      df = df
   ```
</div>
</details>

4) I created the prompt to be sent to OpenAI.

<details>
<summary>System Prompt</summary>
<div markdown="1">

      'created_datetime',
      'openai_topic_1',
      'openai_topic_2'
   ]]
   ```
</div>
</details>

6) Finally, the topic categorization results were loaded into a BigQuery table.

### 2. **Dashboard and Notification Bot**

##### 2.1. Creating the Dashboard `(BigQuery → Redash)`

1) I created a Redash dashboard with the following contents.

##### 2.2. Building the Notification Bot `(BigQuery → Slack API)`

1) First, I wrote a BigQuery query.

<details>
<summary>Extracting the detailed topics (Keywords) with the most significant increase in customer inquiries from the previous week (compared to the week before)</summary>
<div markdown="1">
   ```sql

         `bigquery_tickets_topics_table_id`
      WHERE
         DATE_TRUNC(DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -1 WEEK), WEEK) <= DATE(created_datetime)

      AND tickets_cnt_diff > 0
   ORDER BY
      1
   ```
</div>
</details>

2) I created a Slack message object.

<details>
<summary>View Code</summary>
<div markdown="1">
   ```python
   df = bigquery_client.query(query).to_dataframe()

   # Slack Message Title
   message = f':phone: *Weekly Zendesk Summary* \n\n'
   message += f'*Here are the customer inquiry topics that increased the most in the past week.* \n'

   # If data exists
   if len(df) > 0:
      topics = df['openai_topic_2'].tolist()
      tickets_cnt_1w_agos = df['tickets_cnt_1w_ago'].tolist()
      tickets_cnt_diffs = df['tickets_cnt_diff'].tolist()
      # Create Slack message
      for i, topic in enumerate(topics):
         message += f'- *{topic}*: Total {tickets_cnt_1w_agos[i]} cases (Compared to the previous week +{tickets_cnt_diffs[i]}) \n'

   # If no data exists
   else:
      message += f'- *There are no topics that increased.*:smile: \n\n'
   ```
</div>
</details>

3) Every Monday at 9:00 AM, the following Slack notification was sent.

# 5. Results

> 1. **Cost Savings**
>    * We solved the problem internally at a cost of $25 per month, avoiding the need for an external service that would have cost $300 per month.
> 
> 2. **Time Savings**
>    * The time required for internal team members to follow up on VOC, identify issues, and respond was significantly reduced.

### 1. **Cost Savings**

Conclusion)  By developing internally, we were able to eliminate approximately $275 in opportunity costs each month.

| | **External VOC Analysis Service** | **Internal Development** |
| Monthly Cost | `$300` | `$25` |

1) External VOC Analysis Service
* The [syncly](https://www.syncly.kr/) service we considered adopting required a minimum monthly cost of $299.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-07-20-voc-dashboard/8.png)

2) Internal Development
* However, internal development required the following costs:

| **Resource** | **Monthly Cost** |
| 1. OpenAI API | `$25` |
| 2. BigQuery Storage | Minimal |
| 3. BigQuery Query Usage | Negligible |
| 4. VM Instance Operation | Minimal, as we used existing instances |
| **TOTAL** | `$25` + e |

![ㅇㅇㅇ]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-07-20-voc-dashboard/9.png)
> Daily OpenAI API Costs

### 2. **Time Savings**

1) Redash VOC Dashboard (Topic Categorization)
* Improved <u>the ease of identifying</u> VOC issues for internal team members.

2) Redash VOC Dashboard (Summarization)
