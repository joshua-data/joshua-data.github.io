> "This post summarizes my experience designing and building a data mart to effectively provide new user activation conversion metrics. I designed the data model to flexibly respond to changing business requirements, and focused on queries and structures that are immediately applicable in practice. Through this process, I was able to apply data modeling theory to real-world problem solving and once again realized the importance of deeply understanding requirements."

# 1. The Squad Organization Was Launched!

### 1.1. Background

> Let's focus not just on user acquisition, but on product improvements and marketing activities that lock in new users!

### 1.2. Core Metrics of the Squad

> "Let's increase the **conversion rate of users who perform Key Event 1 within 1 day after their first visit, and Key Event 2 within 7 days**!"

### 1.3. What the Data Analyst Needs to Do

> "Please prepare the data so that we can thoroughly analyze the core metrics and provide them via dashboard."

# 2. What I Needed to Do

### 2.1. Reflecting on the Core Metrics

- The sequence of First Visit - Key Event 1 - Key Event 2 is clear.
- Only conversions within the maximum conversion period are recognized.
- Conversion rates are measured on a user basis.
- The squad's core metrics may change in the future: Key Events and maximum conversion periods.

### 2.2. Let's Build a Data Mart!

- Running queries directly on the Core Layer's `fact__events` would be too complex and costly.
- With the possibility of changes in core metrics, it would be difficult to control query accuracy and delivery.

# 3. A Preview of the Data Mart

### 3.1. `dim__users`

- Already managed as a conformed dimension in the Core Layer.
- SCD Type 1 (only the latest value is kept, no historical values).

| **Column** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `user_id` | User ID |
| `first_date` | First visit date |
| `first_datetime` | First visit datetime |
| `country` | Most recent country |
| `device_os` | Most recent device OS |
| `app_version` | Most recent app version |
| `first_campaign` | UTM Campaign at first visit |
| `first_medium` | UTM Medium at first visit |
| `first_source` | UTM Source at first visit |
| ‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ |

### 3.2. `fact__first_activation_events`

- This is a newly created table for this data mart.
- Only the first events for each user are stored.

| **Column** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `date` | Date of first event occurrence |
| `datetime` | Datetime of first event occurrence |
| `user_id` | User ID |
| `event_name` | Event name |
| `first_visit_date` | User's first visit date |
| `first_visit_datetime` | User's first visit datetime |
| `hours_from_first_visit` | Hours elapsed from first visit to first event |
| `days_from_first_visit` | Days elapsed from first visit to first event |

### 3.3. Example Records

- If the `fact__events` table looks like this for user Jinseok:

| **date** | **datetime** | **user_id** | **event_name** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-01 01:00:00 | Jinseok | `first_visit` |
| 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-01 01:01:00 | Jinseok | `add_to_cart` |
| 2025-01-02 | 2025-01-02 01:00:00 | Jinseok | `add_to_cart` |
| 2025-01-02 | 2025-01-02 01:01:00 | Jinseok | `purchase` |

- The `fact__first_activation_events` table would be constructed as follows, keeping only the first events and adding necessary columns:

| **date** | **datetime** | **user_id** | **event_name** | **first_visit_date** | **first_visit_datetime** | **hours_from_first_visit** | **days_from_first_visit** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-01 01:00:00 | Jinseok | `first_visit` | 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-01 01:00:00 | 1 | 1 |
| 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-01 01:01:00 | Jinseok | `add_to_cart` | 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-01 01:00:00 | 1 | 1 |
| 2025-01-02 | 2025-01-02 01:01:00 | Jinseok | `purchase` | 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-01 01:00:00 | 25 | 2 |

### 3.4. Key Features

- This is a transaction fact table (since `user_id` is present, you can easily filter dimensions via `dim__users`).
- The grain is the combination of `user_id` and `event_name` (only the first event for each user is stored).
- Conversion period information is stored as a pre-calculated non-additive fact (so you don't need to use joins or window functions later).

# 4. Example Queries

### 4.1. Designed for Usability

- If the core metric's Key Event changes? ‚Üí Just modify the `event_name` part.
- If the maximum conversion period changes? ‚Üí Just modify the `hours_from_first_visit` or `days_from_first_visit` part.
- Need to filter by user attributes? ‚Üí Just join with `dim__users`.

### 4.2. Beginner Query

- ‚òùüèª Show the trend of users who converted via `key_event_1` (regardless of conversion period).

```sql
    SELECT
        date,
        COUNT(1) AS users_cnt
    FROM
        fact__first_activation_events
    WHERE TRUE
        AND event_name = 'key_event_1'
    GROUP BY
        1
    ORDER BY
        1
```

### 4.3. Intermediate Query

- ‚òùüèª Show the trend of conversion rates for users who performed `key_event_1` within 1 day of `first_visit`.

```sql
    SELECT
        first_visit_date AS cohort_date,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'first_visit' THEN 1 END) AS first_visit,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'key_event_1' THEN 1 END) AS key_event_1
    FROM
        fact__first_activation_events
    WHERE TRUE
        AND (
            event_name = 'first_visit'
            OR (event_name = 'key_event_1' AND days_from_first_visit <= 1)
        )
    GROUP BY
        1
    ORDER BY
        1
```

- ‚òùüèª (Squad's core metric) Show the trend of conversion rates for users who performed `key_event_1` within 1 day and `key_event_2` within 7 days of `first_visit`.

```sql
    SELECT
        first_visit_date AS cohort_date,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'first_visit' THEN 1 END) AS first_visit,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'key_event_1' THEN 1 END) AS key_event_1,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN event_name = 'key_event_2' THEN 1 END) AS key_event_2
    FROM
        fact__first_activation_events
    WHERE TRUE
        AND (
            event_name = 'first_visit'
            OR (event_name = 'key_event_1' AND days_from_first_visit <= 1)
            OR (event_name = 'key_event_2' AND days_from_first_visit <= 7)
        )
    GROUP BY
        1
    ORDER BY
        1
```

### 4.4. Advanced Query

- ‚òùüèª Show the trend of conversion rates for US users who performed `key_event_1` within 1 day and `key_event_2` within 7 days of `first_visit`.

```sql
    SELECT
        FACT.first_visit_date AS cohort_date,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN FACT.event_name = 'first_visit' THEN 1 END) AS first_visit,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN FACT.event_name = 'key_event_1' THEN 1 END) AS key_event_1,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN FACT.event_name = 'key_event_2' THEN 1 END) AS key_event_2
    FROM
        fact__first_activation_events FACT
    LEFT JOIN
        dim__users DIM
        ON FACT.user_id = DIM.user_id
    WHERE TRUE
        AND DIM.country = 'United States'
        AND (
            FACT.event_name = 'first_visit'
            OR (FACT.event_name = 'key_event_1' AND FACT.days_from_first_visit <= 1)
            OR (FACT.event_name = 'key_event_2' AND FACT.days_from_first_visit <= 7)
        )
    GROUP BY
        1
    ORDER BY
        1
```

# 5. How the Modeling Was Done

### 5.1. [STEP 1] Load the Entire `dim__users` Table

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2025-01-25-first-activation-data-mart/4.webp)

```sql
    WITH
    CTE_first_visits_raw AS (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            first_date AS date,
            first_datetime AS datetime
        FROM
            {% raw %}{{ ref('dim__users') }}{% endraw %}
    ),	
```

### 5.2. [STEP 2] Keep Only New `first_visit` Data

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2025-01-25-first-activation-data-mart/5.webp)

```sql
    {% raw %}{% if is_incremental() %}{% endraw %}

    CTE_first_visits AS (
        SELECT
            SRC.user_id,
            SRC.date,
            SRC.datetime
        FROM
            CTE_first_visits_raw SRC
        LEFT JOIN 
            {% raw %}{{ this }}{% endraw %} EXISTING
            ON SRC.user_id = EXISTING.user_id
            AND EXISTING.event_name = 'first_visit'
        WHERE TRUE
            AND EXISTING.user_id IS NULL
    ),

    {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

### 5.3. [STEP 3] Incrementally Load the `fact__events` Table

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2025-01-25-first-activation-data-mart/6.webp)

```sql
    CTE_events_raw AS (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            event_name,
            MIN(date) AS date,
            MIN(datetime) AS datetime
        FROM
            {% raw %}{{ ref('fact__events') }}{% endraw %}
        WHERE TRUE
            {% raw %}{% if is_incremental() %}{% endraw %}
            AND datetime > (SELECT MAX(datetime) FROM {% raw %}{{ this }}{% endraw %})
            {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
            AND event_name IN (
                'Key Event 1',
                'Key Event 2',
                ...
            )
        GROUP BY
            1, 2
    )
```

### 5.4. [STEP 4] Keep Only New First Key Events

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2025-01-25-first-activation-data-mart/7.webp)

```sql
    {% raw %}{% if is_incremental() %}{% endraw %}
    ,

    CTE_events AS (
        SELECT
            SRC.*
        FROM
            CTE_events_raw SRC
        LEFT JOIN 
            {% raw %}{{ this }}{% endraw %} EXISTING
            ON SRC.user_id = EXISTING.user_id
            AND SRC.event_name = EXISTING.event_name
        WHERE TRUE
            AND EXISTING.user_id IS NULL
            AND EXISTING.event_name IS NULL
    )

    {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

### 5.5. [STEP 5] Combine and Insert New `first_visit` and First Key Events Data

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2025-01-25-first-activation-data-mart/8.webp)

```sql
    SELECT
        date,
        datetime,
        user_id,
        'first_visit' AS event_name,
        date AS first_visit_date,
        datetime AS first_visit_datetime,
        NULL AS hours_from_first_visit,
        NULL AS days_from_first_visit

# 6. Modeling Review

### 6.1. Good Requirement Gathering Leads to Good Data Marts

- A good data mart = a data mart that can be used repeatedly and sustainably
- To accurately understand the squad's core metrics, I spent hours discussing with the squad leader.
    - How exactly is the conversion rate defined?
    - How might the core metrics change in the future?

### 6.2. Data Modeling Is Not Complete with Theory Alone

- There are systematic theories for DWH such as Kimball and Inmon.
- However, the most important thing is: "Does it help solve the problem?"
    - Organizational data usage tendencies, data characteristics, core problems
- The `fact__first_activation_events` table was not created solely based on theory.
    - It was created by applying DWH theory to meet organizational needs.

# 7. Acknowledgements

### 7.1. Inspired by Toss Securities' "DW Design Review" Video

> [Toss SLASH 24 - Designing and Operating a DW for All-Purpose Data Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWDVBZycou4)

- This video provided important clues for understanding the flow of user activation data.

### 7.2. Special Thanks to the Squad Leader

- The squad leader actively helped resolve my questions to provide core metric data.
    - Provided background to help see the business goals clearly.
    - Carefully quantified the core metrics together.
- I am sincerely grateful for the intensive training that helped me align my perspective as a data analyst with the organization's goals.
