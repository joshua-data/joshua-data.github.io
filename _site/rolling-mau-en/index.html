<h1 id="1-star-summary">1. STAR Summary</h1>

<h3 id="situation">Situation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company was consuming <strong>significant time and costs</strong> to calculate and manage complex Rolling Metrics like Rolling MAU. As the number of users increased, it was expected to become even more challenging to extract this metric efficiently, and indeed, the original query took more than <strong>6 hours</strong> to calculate Rolling MAU. Even with an Incremental Strategy applied, it still took <strong>2 hours</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>My goal was to design a query that could calculate the Rolling MAU metric efficiently, drastically reduce execution time, and lower infrastructure costs. This required <strong>query optimization to reduce computational costs and improve performance</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Creating a B-tree Index</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>To speed up the most time-consuming process of calculating Rolling MAU, I created a B-tree Index on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> column to enhance scan speed. This was intended to <strong>reduce the burden of comparison operations</strong> under the following condition:
        <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">SUB</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">date</span> <span class="k">BETWEEN</span> <span class="n">MAIN</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">date</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">INTERVAL</span> <span class="s1">'29 DAYS'</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">MAIN</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">date</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Query Optimization</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Even after creating the B-tree Index, the performance improvement was not sufficient. Therefore, I changed the query to fetch only the necessary columns to reduce memory usage. Instead of fetching all rows from the MAIN table, I fetched only the necessary columns, <strong>significantly reducing the exponential memory usage during the SELF JOIN process.</strong>
        <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">DISTINCT</span> <span class="nb">date</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">daily_activated_users</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Thanks to this optimization strategy, the execution time for the Rolling MAU calculation query was <strong>reduced from 6 hours to 6 seconds.</strong> This led to a dramatic improvement in data processing efficiency and significant cost savings in query execution time and infrastructure. These results helped the company manage complex metrics like Rolling Metrics more efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specific-problem-situation">Specific Problem Situation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The company’s product saw a rapid increase in users over time, making optimization a critical issue from a data warehouse perspective. The Rolling MAU, a key metric for product pricing, played an essential role. However, the calculation process for Rolling MAU was very complex and computationally expensive, which posed a significant challenge.</li>

<h5 id="1-the-existing-query">(1) The Existing Query</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The initial query used a SELF JOIN to calculate the number of active users over the last 30 days for each date. This approach had a computational complexity of O(n²) because it repeatedly retrieved and calculated related data for each date, causing an exponential increase in computation cost as the number of users grew. In practice, this query took more than 6 hours to execute with a Full Scan, and nearly 2 hours even with an Incremental Strategy.

  <li>Identifying the Exact Bottleneck
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The most time-consuming part is step B.</strong> In this step, all rows corresponding to the Recent 2-day Window are concatenated for each row. For example, if there are 10 rows on January 2nd, and 100 rows corresponding to the Recent 2-day Window, a total of 1,000 rows (10*100) need to be concatenated, resulting in a rapid increase in memory usage. The process of concatenating the list of active users for each day through SELF JOIN was the primary cause of excessive scan time and memory usage.</li>
      <li>Given this situation, it became urgent to optimize the Rolling MAU metric to improve efficiency and significantly reduce query execution time. Additionally, continuing to bear such computational costs with the existing infrastructure was inefficient, necessitating optimization to reduce infrastructure costs. In other words, finding a solution to save both time and costs was crucial.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>My goal was to design a query that could calculate the Rolling MAU metric efficiently, drastically reduce execution time, and lower infrastructure costs. This required <strong>query optimization to reduce computational costs and improve performance</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="1-reducing-query-execution-time"><strong>1. Reducing Query Execution Time</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The original query for calculating Rolling MAU had a computational complexity of O(n²), resulting in an execution time of over 6 hours. Drastically reducing this time to achieve near real-time performance was the top priority. Reducing execution time to the second level was essential to quickly analyze changing user activity data and respond immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-reducing-infrastructure-costs"><strong>2. Reducing Infrastructure Costs</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Memory and processing power used during query execution directly translate to costs. The original query had an issue where memory usage increased exponentially as the data volume grew, leading to a sharp rise in infrastructure costs. Therefore, it was necessary to design a query structure that minimized memory usage and efficiently utilized infrastructure resources.</li>

  <li>This drastically reduced the data processing load during SELF JOIN, significantly decreasing memory usage.</li>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Thanks to this optimization strategy, the execution time for the Rolling MAU calculation query was <strong>reduced from 6 hours to 6 seconds.</strong> This led to a dramatic improvement in data processing efficiency and significant cost savings in query execution time and infrastructure. These results helped the company manage complex metrics like Rolling Metrics more efficiently.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="dramatic-reduction-in-query-execution-time"><strong>Dramatic Reduction in Query Execution Time</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Since Rolling MAU was a key metric for product pricing, this issue was of significant importance.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before Optimization</strong>: The query for calculating Rolling MAU took about 6 hours</li>
      <li><strong>After Optimization</strong>: The same task was completed in just 6 seconds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The reduced execution time enabled more stable product operations and saved the company from considering alternative pricing methods, thereby saving opportunity costs.</li>
</ul>
